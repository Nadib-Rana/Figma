With Figma's free plan, you can create up to **three active projects** (known as files) in the team workspace. However, in your **personal workspace**, you can create and store as many design files as you'd like. Key details for the free plan are:

1. **3 Projects per Team**: You can have three team-based projects where you can invite collaborators. If you need more, you’ll need to archive or delete older projects.
2. **Unlimited Personal Files**: In your personal workspace, you can create unlimited design files, but they won’t be as collaboration-focused as team files.
3. **Access to Core Tools**: You’ll have access to design, prototyping, and basic sharing features, though some advanced features (like version history beyond 30 days) are limited to paid plans.
